Thanks for submitting the assignment. You’ve got some good code here, but more work is needed to meet the assignment requirements. Your page contains all of the required sections, nav links, your name. Its nav elements link to all of their corresponding page sections, but it lacks examples of your work and all of their requirements (titled images of each project first project image larger than the others, clicking a project links to its deployed site etc). The site layout isn't responsive (doesn't adapt its content to mobile viewports).

Your code repo has a good file structure and descriptive code comments, but it lacks a quality README (screenshot, deployed link, description), its commits lack detail ('final changes'), and its name could use improvement. Code repos are best named after what their code content ‘is’ or ‘does’ rather than their chronology as assignments in the Bootcamp or something random (ie ‘Professional_Portfolio’ rather than ‘Homework-2’ or 'thing' etc), so keep that in mind for future challenges.

When making commit messages, try to briefly communicate what code has been changed and in which files (ie: ‘Added comments to style.css’). That way, someone reading your commit messages can understand how the code has evolved without needing to look at the files themselves.

Be sure to check in with your Instructional Staff about your progress and feel free to take advantage of the Tutors, Learning Assistants, and other resources available to you with the course.
